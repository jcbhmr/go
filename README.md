# Go multiplatform

ðŸ“¦ Multiplatform self-extracting single-executable Go bundles \
ðŸ”€ Forked from [golang/go](https://github.com/golang/go)

```sh
wget https://github.com/jcbhmr/go/releases/download/go1.23.0/go1.23.0.ape.zip
unzip go1.23.0.ape.zip
./go/go help
```

</table>

ðŸŒŒ Bundles multiple platform-specific binaries into a single cross-platform binary \
ðŸŸ¦ Works on Windows too! \
ðŸ˜Ž It's _one binary_ \
ðŸ“‚ Extracts & caches the the Go root & platform-specific binaries to a cache folder

## Installation

![Windows](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Windows&color=0078D4&logo=Windows&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![Linux](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Linux&color=222222&logo=Linux&logoColor=FCC624&label=)
![macOS](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=macOS&color=000000&logo=macOS&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

**ðŸ›‘ This project is unofficial.** You should probably use [the official Go download page](https://go.dev/dl/). 

1. Download the zip.
2. Extract the zip.
3. \[Windows only\] Rename `go` and `gofmt` to have a `.com` or `.exe` suffix.

**https://github.com/jcbhmr/go/releases/download/go1.23.0/go1.23.0.ape.zip**

The all-in-one binaries should work on the following platforms:

- Windows x86-64
- Windows AArch64
- macOS x86-64
- macOS AArch64
- Linux x86-64
- Linux AArch64

TODO: Add the relevant \*BSDs that `cosmocc` also supports

You can check the [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) page for more platforms.

## Development

![C++](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=C%2B%2B&color=00599C&logo=C%2B%2B&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=GitHub+Actions&color=2088FF&logo=GitHub+Actions&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

This is a fork of the Go repository. I doubt the Go team would want to release a Cosmopolitan APE binary. ðŸ˜­ This project is **unofficial**.

Right now there's [a bug in Cosmopolitan Libc](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/issues/1248) that has been fixed but hasn't been published as a release yet. You'll need to build `cosmocc` from source to use the fix.
